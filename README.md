# MyTicTacToe_Game
Built a functional and interactive Tic‐Tac‐Toe game through vim, that allows two individuals to play against each other.
# How to use and how it works
1. Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game played on a grid of 3x3 squares. 
2. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) in empty squares. 
3. The goal is to form a line of three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
4. The first player to achieve this wins the game.
